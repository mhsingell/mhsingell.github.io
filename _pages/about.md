Hi, I’m Madison! I’m a PhD Candidate in Organizational Behavior at the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/academic-experience/students/madison-singell). My research explores how the stories we tell impact our ability to organize well. 

At the GSB, I am a member of the [Computational Culture Lab](https://www.comp-culture.org/), and the methods I use to study narratives stem from this lab’s tradition. I’m a computational and mathematical modeler, and I also use natural language processing and other computational methods to identify narratives in text data. Prior to graduate school, I received my bachelor’s degree in Economics from Harvard and spent several years working in consulting, technology, and people analytics research. 

I will be on the 2024-2025 academic job market. You can find the most up to date version of my job market paper here. (INSERT FILE)

## Why Narratives in Organizations? 
Narratives are a key way humans convey meaning and negotiate interpretations. In organizations, in order to decide what to do next, it's important stakeholders agree about what happened. But employees often don’t agree and struggle to reach convergence of narratives, even in a shared context like an organization. I study how the nature of the world, our experiences, and our culture impacts the narratives we form, in order to understand how organizations who are seeking to form convergent strategies can better navigate the pitfalls of narrative divergence.
