**Yang, Lara**, Amir Goldberg, Sameer Srivastava. ["Locally Ensconced and Globally Integrated: How Positions in Network Structure Relate to a Language-Based Model of Group Identification."](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zrpx7) *Revise and Resubmit at American Journal of Sociology.*

Shifting attachments to social groups are a constant in the modern era. What accounts for variation in the strength of group identification? Whereas prior work has emphasized group-level properties and individual differences, this article instead highlights the role of positions within network structure. Distilling insights from prior work on networks and identity, we propose that identification strength is positively related to network cohesion—having contacts who are mutually interconnected. Departing from prevailing accounts, we further propose that identification strength can separately arise through network range—having contacts who inhabit a broad range of network communities. Using the tools of computational linguistics to develop a language-based measure of identification, we find consistent support for the theory using pooled data of internal communications from three disparate organizations.


## Working Papers
**Yang, Lara**. ["Contextualizing Homophily: How Similarity in Enacted Identity Shapes Social Ties."](/files/jmp.pdf) *Job Market Paper.*

Homophily is a fundamental principle that orders and structures social ties. Existing work conceptualizes homophily as a static phenomenon. In the commonly studied case of gender homophily, for instance, two individuals either share the same gender or they do not. However, a core insight in the identity literature is that identities are dynamically enacted as a function of social contexts and interactions. Integrating this insight, I maintain that homophily is also a dynamic, interactional, and contextualized process. Building on prior work, I theorize that similarity in enacted identity predicts tie existence and strengthens existing ties. I further deconstruct enacted identity similarity into its intra-relational and extra-relational components. That is, for each pair of individuals, I distinguish between identity enacted within and outside of the purview of their relationship. Under the contextualized view of identity, intra- and extra-relational enacted identities should diverge, and only intra-relational enacted identity similarity should strengthen social ties. Finally, I contend that the effect of intra-relational enacted identity similarity is amplified when enacted in private contexts, as privacy renders enacted identities more authentic and intimate. By applying word embedding models to a corpus of proprietary Slack communication records, I develop a novel approach to measuring enacted identity and its similarity. Through analyzing channel membership on Slack, I identify the intra-relational and extra-relational components of enacted identity similarity. Combining this approach with responses from a network survey, I find consistent support for my hypotheses.

## Work in Progress
**Yang, Lara**, Grace Cormier, Paul Green, and Sameer Srivastava. "The Effects of A Network-Based Learning Intervention on Belongingness and Inclusion in the Workplace." *Analyzing Data.*

In this project, we aim to improve inclusion and belongingness at work by rewiring individuals’ social networks. Building on the two pathways to identification highlighted in *Locally Ensconced*, we designed a field experiment with two conditions – one focused on fostering cohesion, and one on fostering range. Partnering with a non-profit organization, we implemented this intervention recently. Data from follow-up surveys will reveal if this intervention can move the needle on our outcomes of interest. Preliminary data suggests *global reach*, the measure we developed to capture network range, significantly and positively predicts self-reported measures of inclusion and belongingness.

**Yang, Lara**. "A Large-Scale Computational Study of Glassdoor Reviews Shows the Performance (Dis)advantages of Organizational Identification." *Analyzing Data.*

In this project, I ask how average levels of employee organizational identification relate to organizational performance. To answer this question, I analyze Glassdoor reviews and data from Compustat. Given the difference between email data (Locally Ensconced) and Glassdoor data, I develop a revised language model of identification that operationalizes identification as the degree to which it demonstrates we-language as opposed to I-language. I do so by projecting each review on an I-we word embedding dimension. My results demonstrate that, while organizational identification positively predicts market performance, there exists a curvilinear relationship between organizational identification and operational performance. I find that this curvilinear relationship is affected by two opposing forces. Identification increases the amount of effort employees exert, but also makes individuals more entrenched in the current ways of doing things and less willing to communicate and discuss issues within the organization.

Carroll, Glenn, and **Lara Yang**. "Gender and Culture in Organizations: Perceptions, Beliefs, and Experiences." *Analyzing Data.*

In this project, we examine how one’s gender identity relates to cultural perceptions and beliefs. We surveyed a cross-section of the American workforce to collect data on how male and female employees perceive and experience organizational culture. Controlling for job characteristics and experience, we find that female employees value culture more strongly but evaluate culture more negatively. In follow-up work, we investigate whether these differences make female employees more effective cultural leaders.
